## REST API Service
This REST API framework is designed to suit highly scalable modern applications. It has a modular architecture with two fold routing to make the code simple even for very large projects. It has facility to enforce schema validation to ensure data integrity before storing it in the database. The error handling can be done locally at every API level and (or) globally using middleware. The unit tests are integrated with mocha JavaScript testing framework and integration test can be done with CurL. This framework has the following major technology stack.
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB Database
- Mongoose driver
- Mocha JavaScript unit testing
- ES6 Syntax


### Project directory structures
```bash
# project root directory
api_server.js : The node.js server application.
app.js : The main Express application

##### this framework has two fold routing
# ./routes folder
High level routing modules

# ./controllers
API level routing definitions
database access logic

# ./models
Data Model Definitions

# ./test
All unit tests root directory

# ./test/controllers
Test for each API defined in the controllers

# ./public
API Documentation
```


#### Get the demo source code
```bash
# cd /work
cd c:\work

git clone https://github.com/msatyan/ApiServe1.git

# fetch all dependent packages
# cd /work/ApiServe1
cd c:\work\ApiServe1
npm install
```


### Starting the REST API service
```bash
# cd /work/ApiServe1
cd c:\work\ApiServe1

# Make sure the mongodb is up and running
# Edit app.js to update the mongodb connection information
npm start

# or
# node api_server.js
```

### Run unit testing.
Currently the unit test is configured to run on watch mode with the help of nodemon. The nodemon watchout for source code change and automatically restart the test.
```bash
# Edit test/test_helper.js to update the mongodb connection information used for test.
# cd /work/ApiServe1
cd c:\work\ApiServe1

npm  run test
```




```bash
# Currently only the product REST API has data access facility implemented.
# The remaining REST API will give you dummy response without doing database access.

# REST API implementations
http://localhost:3000/v1/product


# Static page serving for documentation
http://localhost:3000/
```



### Test REST APIs with curl
You may use Visual Studio Code with REST Client plugin for convenient way of invoking CURL command from a script with HTTP extension.

## Populate few records in the database.
```bash

# POST record-1
curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "name" : "CD",
  "description" : "Very good CD",
  "price": 10.24
}
' "http://localhost:3000/v1/product"

# POST record-2
curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "name" : "DVD",
  "description" : "Very good DVD",
  "price": 12.56
}
' "http://localhost:3000/v1/product"


# POST record-3
curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "name" : "BR",
  "description" : "Very good BR",
  "price": 15.80
}
' "http://localhost:3000/v1/product"

```

### Select records
```bash
# GET a list of records
curl    -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/product
curl    -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/product?minprice=11&maxprice=14

# Select a single record (the above command should list the ID)
curl    -X GET  http://localhost:3000/v1/product/< ID of the record you plan to select>
# eg:
curl    -X GET  http://localhost:3000/v1/product/5c8d8e0974a64030b4bb60bf

# TODO: with basic auth
# curl -u dbuser1:MyPassword -X GET  http://localhost:3000/v1/product
```

### Delete
```bash
#DELETE
curl    -X DELETE  http://localhost:3000/v1/product/< ID of the record >
# eg:
curl    -X DELETE  http://localhost:3000/v1/product/5c8d8e0974a64030b4bb60bf
```



### The CURD design pattern followed
This snapshot has CURD design pattern used and the most frequent used HTTP status codes.

#### POST Create
```
Entire Collection:
201 (Created), 'Location' header with link to /product/{id} containing new ID.
Specific Item:
404 (Not Found), 409 (Conflict) if resource already exists.
```

#### GET Read
```
Entire Collection:
200 (OK), list of products. Use pagination, sorting and filtering to navigate big lists.
Specific Item:
200 (OK), single product. 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid.
```

#### PUT Update/Replace
```
Entire Collection:
404 (Not Found), unless you want to update/replace every resource in the entire collection.
Specific Item:
200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid.
```

#### PATCH Update/Modify
```
Entire Collection:
404 (Not Found), unless you want to modify the collection itself.
Specific Item:
200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid.
```

#### DELETE
```
Entire Collection:
404 (Not Found), unless you want to delete the whole collectionâ€”not often desirable.
Specific Item:
200 (OK). 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid.
```

### FYI: Debug the solution.
You may choose any technique that you are already familiar for debugging the solution. However it is worth evaluating the following tools for your solution development activity.

- ##### Debug Frontend: [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)
Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. DevTools can help you edit pages on-the-fly and diagnose problems quickly.

```

- ##### Debug Backend: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
The Visual Studio Code editor has built-in debugging support for the Node.js runtime and can debug JavaScript, TypeScript, and many other languages that are transpiled into JavaScript.
